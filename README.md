### 🧑‍💻 A little bit about me:
Hello! 👋 <br>
My name is Gleb, and I'm an aspiring developer from Russia. I'm currently experimenting with web development and am also looking to get into game development in the future. I'm a second-year student at a technical college, majoring in Programming. There's not too much to tell about myself just yet, but I'm hoping to change that soon. 😉
